==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

The script run_analysis.R does the following

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  Files 'train/X_train.txt' and 'test/X_test.txt'  are combined, files 'train/y_train.txt' and 'test/y_test.txt'  are combined and files 'train/subject_train.txt' and 'test/subject_test.txt' are combined.   The resulting variable names are "X_combine", 
"y_combine" and "subject_combine".

2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  All the variables in the data set are listed in file 'features.txt'.  The contents of the file 'features.txt' are searched for strings containing either "mean" or "std".  Based on this information, appropriate columns are extracted from the "X_combine" variable into "X_combine_mean_std" variable.

3.  Adds descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.   The activities for each set are listed in 'train/y_train.txt' and 'test/y_test.txt' ; they are coded as numbers 1-6.  File 'activity_labels.txt' has the activity description for each of the numeric codes.  Variable "activities" is createdbased on "y_combine" variable and file 'activity_labels.txt'  and stores the descriptive activity names for the combined set

4.  Labels the data set with descriptive variable names.    All the variables in the data set are listed in file 'features.txt'; the 
same approach described above in step #2 is used to extract the appropriate variable names from the list and assign the names to the columns of "X_combine_mean_std".

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  The column names for the features in this data set are changed from XXX to Avg_XXX by adding "Avg_" in front of each column name.  The result is written out in a "TidyDataSet.txt" file.
